# Problem 2

Even Fibonacci numbers

## Description
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Compilation
### Option 1
`$ make`
### Option 2
1. `$ mkdir -p bin`

2. `$ gcc -Wall -O3 -o bin/problem2 main.c`

## Execution
`$ ./bin/problem2`

## Output
`Result: <total>`
