# Problem 37

Truncatable primes

## Description

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

## Compilation
### Option 1
`$ make`
### Option 2
1. `$ mkdir -p bin`

2. `$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -O3 -o bin/problem37 main.c`

## Execution
`$ ./bin/problem37`

## Output
`Result: <total>`
